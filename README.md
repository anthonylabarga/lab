A catch-all repository for investigating stuff I'm interested in, doing background work for blog posts, etc.

## Things to generally learn/investigate

- [ ] Graph neural networks

## Specific experiments to do

- [ ] How well NNs learn simple functions (sine, etc.) based on number of provided examples, activation functions, etc.
- [ ] Simple examples of applying and then reversing a Fourier transform
